}
font-size: 20px; 
 // you can control the font sie by altering the pixel size. 
 
 // Classes and Ids allow you to select a specific items that you wan to styize different from the ::-webkit-search-results-button
  ex. <h1> id="name"> Maegan SKinner />
      <h2> id="location"> Dallas />
      // to trgger the is you can use #idname{ } to denote the id you want to use
    // because of specificuty, the comuter will always use the most specifc style choce if there are multiple options
       - !important can be used to override style 
       - when it comes to specifity the newest style will always win

    // You can have multiple elemens with the sae class, but only one id per item.

// To use the above stylesheet all you need to do is link it in your document
// Keep in mind that the cascade applies the most recent file, so if you want a css 
//  to take precedent over a file, simply put it on to of the other file(s) denoting 
//  that it is the most "recent"

   <div class=box 
// Lets say you have two boxes and you want to smae styling but diffenet background color
//   you would do this as DRY as possible. Simply hibe box1 and box2 the same properties
//   but the background color will be different 

// DISPLAY
//  you can change the position of an object on the screen by manipulating the "display" type the object. 
//  ex. block, inline, inline block, none 

// POSITION
// You can manipulate the position of something on the screen by moving it pixel wise to the left, right,  
//  top, bottom, absolute, fixed, and sticky.

// SEMANTIC html
// The correct way to use semantics is so you can communicate with the computer as to what you wan it to
//  do and what is most important to least important.
// Avoid <div> soup, use <nav> too
